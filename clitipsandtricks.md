# Command Line Tips and Tricks

## macOS terminal

To get the most of this workshop, it's worth briefly reviewing some command line shortcuts that will help you make more art more quickly.

* `control + A` : moves cursor to the beginning of the line
* `control + E` : moves cursor to the end of the line
* `control + C` : kills a running process
* `command + N` : opens a new terminal window
* `command + T` : opens a new terminal tab
* `command + K` : clears terminal to start
* `command + L` : clears terminal to previous mark
* `Holding the Option key + moving the pointer` : repositions the insertion point (super handy for switching a `-p` flag to a `-s` flag)
* `command + Plus (+)` : makes terminal font bigger
* `command + Minus (-)` : makes terminal font smaller
* `Arrow Up` : scrolls through previously entered commands
* `Arrow Down` : goes in the opposite direction
* `Tab` : autocompletes a command after typing a few letters

## PowerShell

* `Home` : moves cursor to the beginning of the line
* `End` : moves cursor to the end of the line
* `Del` : erases character to the right of the cursor
* `Backspace` : erases character to the left of the cursor
* `Esc` : deletes entire current line
* `control + Home` : deletes all characters at the current position up to the beginning of the line
* `control + End` : deletes everything from the current cursor position up to the end of the line
* `Arrow Up` : scrolls through previously entered commands
* `Arrow Down` : goes in the opposite direction
* `Tab` : autocompletes a command after typing a few letters
